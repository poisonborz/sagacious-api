## GraphQL Boulerplate

A reasonable, well-equipped boilerplate for a GraphQL + REST API. Based on [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) + [Koa](https://devdocs.io/koa/) + [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/), it uses a simple structure to define models, and expose both models and methods on very similar GQL/REST endpoints, minimising extension overhead. Includes JWT auth and documentation generation. The example use case is simple warehouse management system.

### Usage

Dependencies: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10+

Execute `npm install` in the project root.
Start the server with either `npm run dev` or `npm run prod`.
