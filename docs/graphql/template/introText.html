    <h2>About this documentation</h2>
    <p>This is a listing of the GraphQL API endpoints - additional endpoints for extended functionality (Sales, R&D cockpit / Analytics) will follow.</p>
    <p>The API exposes most entities and properties listed to REST endpoints - for syntax, refer to the <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/docs/rest">">REST
        docs</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Authorization is not part of this API endpoint. For that, please refer to the <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/docs/public">General API
        docs</a>.</p>
    <p>Any GraphQL endpoint is only accessible with a valid access token (authorization header).</p>


    <h2>A very short intro on the buildup</h2>
        <br>
        <p><b>Groups</b></p>
        <p>In the Sagacious system, groups provide an organisational structure that contain entities like assets (tracked tools, machines) or users.
        Groups can form tree hierarchies, where higher level groups have visibility over all subgroups and their entities.</p>
        <p>Additionally, groups in different hierarchies may have visibility over assets that they created. This way situations can be covered like:</p>

        <p><b>The most important entity types:</b></p>
        <ul class="clist">
            <li>Groups have users and assets, providing visibility/access controls</li>
            <li>Users have a role with possible rights to which resources or interface components they can access</li>
            <li>Assets are either tracked (have connected Modules) or are inventory/commodity items</li>
        </ul>

       <p> All above elements can be managed and customized on the apps and through the API.</p>
