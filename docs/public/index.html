        <p>The <b>Sagacious API</b> is an extensive window to your warehouse. The system allows querying and management of various types of assets, asset data, analysis, inventory in an adaptable way to any organisational structure.</p>

        <p>This page has general info and public endpoints. To see what data the API currently offers, view the <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/graphql/">GraphQL docs</a>.</p>


        <h2>API usage</h2>


        <p>Both the GraphQL and REST API available only to authenticated users / API clients and require an <b>authentication</b>
            header containing the <b>access token</b> on each request.</p>

        <p>Getting authentication and requesting general data is happening through the public REST
            endpoints described below.</p>

        <h3>Authentication</h3>

        <p class="url">https://api.acmecorp.com<span class="url--main">/auth</span></p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">POST</span>
            Send a user-inputted <span class="sub">name</span> and a <span class="sub">password</span> value
            as x-www-form-urlencoded to this endpoint to receive the following response:
        </p>

        <pre><code data-language="javascript">
    {
        "tokenAccess": "...", // the access token used to make operation requests
        "tokenRefresh": "..." // the refresh token used to request new access tokens
        "user": { // user object for display
            "id": "7MGdFR4m", // id-s are hashed
            "email": "johnsmith@company.com",
            "roleId": "gX4a3F8O",
            "firstname": "John",
            "lastname": "Smith",
            "created": "2019-01-01T10:00:00.000Z",
            "image": "...", // url to a 250x250px jpg image. Use _2x postfix filename for hdpi version.
            "belongsToGroupId": "44pCFxZW",
            "roleKey": "ManufacturerUser" // role key. can be used to switch role-dependent layouts.
        }
    }
        </code></pre>

        <p>The response contains the access token - this should be placed as the value of header named
            <b>authorization</b>
            for each request to the endpoints.</p>

        <p>The access tokens have a lifespan of <b>10 minutes</b>, so you need to continually refresh them using the
            /authRefresh endpoint.</p>

        <p class="url">https://api.acmecorp.com<span class="url--main">/authRefresh</span></p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">POST</span> Using the tokenRefresh token above, send a <span class="sub">refresh</span> value as x-www-form-urlencoded to
            this endpoint to receive an object containing a single <b>tokenAccess</b> property similar to above, which you can
            use to make further operation requests.
        </p>

        <pre><code data-language="javascript">
    {
        "tokenRefresh": "...", // the refresh token received during authentication
    }
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            The refresh tokens have a lifespan of <b>45 days</b>, after which your users need to log in again.
        </p>


        <h3>Registration</h3>

        <p style="opacity: .3" class="url">https://api.acmecorp.com<span class="url--main">/registration</span></p>

        <p>Currently creation of users is either happening through the API, or through Sagacious admins
            (for the first users). In the near future clients will be able to allow free registration for new users through invitation links /
            registration codes.</p>

        <h3>Let's start querying!</h3>

        <p>Both the <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/graphql/">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/rest/">
            REST</a> endpoints expose mostly the same underlying strucxture, in their respective query formats.</p>

        <h4>
            Refer to the <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/docs/graphql/">GraphQL docs</a> for the structural overview and
            full description of each entity and their properties, methods, and return values, while the <a href="https://api.acmecorp.com/docs/rest/">
            REST docs</a> describes the syntax for the REST syntax necessary to access the same data structures.
        </h4>


        <h3>Special header options</h3>
        <p>
            <b>current-group-id</b> - set this header value to any group id below the user's original group in the tree  - this way, the response
            will reflect if the user would be assigned to that group, and return entities for that or below that group. Handy for
            "view change" functionality where an app presents a group tree where the user can switch between groups.
